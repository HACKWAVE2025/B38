🧠 GoalWise AI — Personalized Financial Goal Planner

“Plan smart. Save better. Achieve faster.”

GoalWise AI is an AI-powered personal finance assistant that turns plain English goals (like “Save ₹50,000 for a laptop by March 2026”) into actionable savings plans — complete with automated breakdowns, progress visualization, and AI-driven suggestions.

Built for modern individuals who want to track multiple financial goals effortlessly, GoalWise AI combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and interactive data visualization to make money management simple, smart, and engaging.
